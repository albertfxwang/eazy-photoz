Templates with redshift-dependent SFHs that disfavor SFHs that start earlier 
than the age of the universe at a given epoch.  

`4590.fits` is the best-fit template to the extreme emission line galaxy
at z=8.5 with a NIRSpec spectrum, provided by A. Carnall, rescaled to roughly
match the normalization of the FSPS templates.

This template is interpreted as a stellar mass / SFR of zero when computing 
those parameters with eazy, so be wary of those numbers for sources where it
dominates the best-fit.
